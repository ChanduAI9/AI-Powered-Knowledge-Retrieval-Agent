### 📌 1. Problem Statement (Improved)

> In Microsoft Teams channels, technical knowledge such as solutions, documentation, and ideas are shared in chat messages, but they are difficult to discover later. Users often repeat the same questions because existing answers are buried in chat history and traditional keyword search is ineffective.
>
> This project builds an **AI-powered knowledge retrieval agent** for Microsoft Teams that automatically retrieves **previously shared solutions and documentation** using **semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, and responds directly within the same Teams channel when a relevant answer already exists.

### 📌 2. High-Level Architecture

```
User (Microsoft Teams Channel)
            ↓
     Microsoft Teams Bot
            ↓
      Backend API (FastAPI)
            ↓
     Semantic Search Layer
     (Vector DB + Embeddings)
            ↓
   Agent Decision Layer (RAG)
            ↓
Response sent back to Teams Channel
```

Key idea:

* Teams is the **interface**
* Backend is the **brain**
* Vector DB is the **memory**
* Agent is the **decision maker**

---

### 📌 3. Component Responsibilities (Clear & Explicit)

#### 1️⃣ Microsoft Teams Bot

* Listens to user messages in Teams channels
* Identifies user queries
* Sends responses back to the same channel
* Passes messages to backend via API

---

#### 2️⃣ Backend API (FastAPI)

* Central orchestration layer
* Receives messages from Teams bot
* Handles:

  * Query processing
  * Knowledge ingestion
  * Calling semantic search
* Communicates with vector database and agent layer

---

#### 3️⃣ Semantic Search Layer (Vector Database)

* Stores embeddings of user-shared content
* Performs similarity search for incoming queries
* Returns top relevant past solutions or documentation

---

#### 4️⃣ Agent Decision Layer (RAG)

* Determines whether a retrieved answer is relevant enough
* Prevents hallucinations by responding **only when knowledge exists**
* Summarizes retrieved content into a clean response
* Decides to reply or decline (“no answer found”)

---

### 📌 4. Data Flow (Two Clear Scenarios)

---

#### 🔹 Scenario 1: User Asks a Question

1. User asks a question in a Teams channel
2. Teams Bot captures the message and sends it to the backend
3. Backend converts the query into an embedding
4. Vector database performs semantic similarity search
5. Agent evaluates relevance and confidence
6. If answer exists → summarized response sent back to Teams
7. If no answer exists → bot replies “No existing solution found”

---

#### 🔹 Scenario 2: User Shares Knowledge (Solution / Documentation)

1. User posts a solution, idea, or documentation in Teams
2. Teams Bot forwards the message to backend
3. Backend processes and cleans the content
4. Content is converted into embeddings
5. Embeddings and metadata are stored in vector database
6. Knowledge becomes available for future queries
